The session I gave at [Blend Conf](http://2013.blendconf.com/schedule/designers-can-open-source/) in Sep 2013.

I discuss the benefits of open source, how they are working for open source development, and how we could utilize them in the design industry.

This was also the start of [Design Open](http://designopen.org)
